			<h1>My Favorite Hobby <br><span id="name">Reading Books</span></h1>
			<div class="line"></div>
            <h2>My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go home from my school I like to read books like Harry Potter after completing my homework. I am 11 years old and I study in grade 6. Now I know that reading is a very good habit which can make anyone, a complete person. This hobby can be developed by anyone, however, I got this hobby which I admire, naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is a good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration, and instruction. Once a reader picks a book, it is really difficult for them to put it down. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual, and most importantly a successful person in their life.</h2>
